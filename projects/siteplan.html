            <h2>Why choose steel frame construction</h2>
            <p>Steel frame construction is becoming increasingly popular for several reasons, offering distinct advantages over traditional building methods. Here’s why it might be a good choice:</p>
        </section>
        <section id="purpose1">
            <h2>1. Strength and Durability</h2>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Resilience:</strong>  Steel is much stronger than wood or concrete, making it highly resistant to environmental stresses like wind, earthquakes, and heavy loads.</p>
                <p><strong>Longevity</strong> It doesn’t warp, crack, or rot over time, ensuring a longer lifespan for structures.</p>
            </ul>            
        </section>
        <section id="purpose2">
            <h2>2. Lightweight and Easy to Transport</h2>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Efficiency: </strong>Steel components are lighter compared to materials like concrete, which reduces transportation costs and simplifies the handling process on-site.</p> 
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="purpose3"> 
            <h2>3. Precision and Customization</h2>
            <ul> 
                <p><strong>Prefabrication: </strong>Steel frames are manufactured with high precision, allowing for faster assembly and reducing construction errors.</p>
                <p><strong>Flexible Design: </strong>Steel's versatility supports complex architectural designs and open spaces, offering creative freedom to builders and architects.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="purpose4">
            <h2>4. Faster Construction</h2>
            <ul>            
                <p><strong>Time-Saving: </strong>Steel frame systems are often prefabricated and can be quickly assembled on-site, reducing construction timelines compared to traditional methods.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="purpose5">
            <h2>5. Sustainability</h2>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Recyclable:</strong> Steel is 100% recyclable, making it an environmentally friendly choice.</p>
                <p><strong>Energy Efficiency: </strong>Modern steel construction incorporates insulation materials and thermal barriers, improving energy efficiency in buildings.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="purpose6">
            <h2>6. Fire and Pest Resistance</h2>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Non-Combustible: </strong>Steel doesn’t catch fire, making it a safer option.</p>
                <p><strong>Pest-Proof: </strong>Unlike wood, steel is immune to termites and other pests that can compromise a structure's integrity.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="purpose7">
            <h2>7. Cost-Effectiveness</h2>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Reduced Maintenance: </strong>Lower maintenance requirements over time offset the initial investment.</p>
                <p><strong>Long-Term Value: </strong>The durability and resilience of steel lead to fewer repairs and replacements, making it cost-effective in the long run.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="purpose8">
            <h2>8. Ideal for Modern Construction Needs</h2>
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Adaptability: </strong>Steel framing is ideal for both residential and commercial projects, as well as renovations and expansions.</p>
                <p><strong>Green Building Certifications: </strong>It supports achieving green building standards like LEED, which is increasingly important in modern construction.</p>
